<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## General Information
I worked with the Iowa Liquor dataset because I know that entry-level Data Scientist and Data Analysts jobs primarily deal with dirty data, and the Iowa Liquor dataset had more dirty data than one might recognize at first glance (most of the difficulties arise as one inspects the values in a few of the pandas Series). I was interested in how much data the state of Iowa had collected (over 12.5 million rows) of liquor sales across about five years.

For more about Iowaâ€™s plan concerning collecting and releasing many datasets, see their webpage.

My theoretical clients are major liquor retailers in Iowa (and perhaps similar places) who would benefit from knowing projects profits and categories of liquor in order that they might restock effectively. 

## Purpose and Hypothesis
I aim to predict sales and in order that clients will know about how much profit they may earn in a given timeframe. I think, given the extensive amount of data gathered, the models will yield accurate predictions. 

## Data Collection
As of late-2020, the website from which one can download the Iowa Liquor Sales datasets as a CSV files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/iowa-liquor-sales) (3.23 GB) and the [official government webpage (where liquor sales are downloaded per year)](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy).
